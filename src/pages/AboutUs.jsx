        We believe that our main goal is to develop our studentâ€™s gifts and
        talents within the classroom and even beyond. We focus not only helping
        our students achieve the highest academic standards, but also to be
        ambitious, confident individuals. At T.IKS we believe that the key to
        achieving success within the school environment is promoting mutual
        respect, being determined, giving others what you hope to receive and
        always trying your best.

        swimming pool, a library and various other important facilities and
        services to ensure that the learning environment meets our expectations.
